## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Token Invalid**: Ensure your PAT has the required permissions
2. **No Artifacts Found**: Verify that:
   - Repositories have GitHub Actions configured

   - Your PAT has sufficient permissions
3. **Download Errors**: Check:
   - Available disk space
   - Write permissions in Downloads folder
   - Network connectivity
