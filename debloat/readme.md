## 🖌️ UI Customization

This script focuses solely on debloating and privacy. For customizing the Windows 11 UI (context menus, taskbar, etc.), use our companion script [set-tweakW11.ps1](../ui-tweaks/set-tweakW11.ps1).

## ⚠️ Caution

- Always create a system restore point before running
- Some changes may not be easily reversible
- Some apps might be removed that you want to keep, so review the selection carefully

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this break my Windows installation?

No, the script is designed to be safe and only removes non-essential components.

### Can I undo the changes?

Some changes can be reversed through the Windows Settings app, but a system restore point is recommended before running.

### Why separate debloating from UI tweaks?

To provide more flexibility and focus. This script focuses on removing unnecessary components and enhancing privacy, while the UI tweaks script focuses on visual and usability enhancements.
